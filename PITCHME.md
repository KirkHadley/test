## HMS and Improved Claims Selection: Moving Towards Deep Learning

* Current Claims Selection processes, in both complex and data mining products are developed in an ad hoc process that ultimately results in poorer results
* How can we make it better?

+++

## Machine Learning

* Initial testing shows that traditional machine learning models are a welcome improvement over SAS
  * 20% cost savings, 15% new claims
* Is this good enough?
  * It sounds like it should be, but there's hidden costs here.
  * Primarily:
    * Maintenance- having to regularly retrain after deployment
    * Silent failures
* Where to next?

## Enter Deep Learning

* What's deep learning offer that we don't get out of the traditional approaches?
* Robustness
* Online training
* Leveraging unique structure of our domain
  * Graph Theory!

+++

## How Do We Actually Do This?

* Great question, but first! A demo

+++

## That was boring

* I agree. But we can fix that, and it's as simple as leveraging our existing infra
